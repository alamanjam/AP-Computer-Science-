670.  @iamlallal This feature is called a “jet”. Matter from this jet is ejected at light speed, so very fast!
671.  @yummymuscle No light can escape - but before matter falls into the event horizon a black hole, it releases fireworks of X–rays.
672.  @Mr_Bob_FTW Think of a black hole as a singularity of almost infinite density.  Wormhole would be a tunnel to another part of the universe.
673.  @Downtowngoose Nothing, not even light, can escape from a black hole. So it all gets swallowed beyond the event horizon.
674.  @BigCatSwox You can think of the blackness of a black hole as a dark sphere, since everything inside that radius is lost forever.
675.  @tommyvlaming Quasar = light emitted from hot material that swirls around a black hole *before* it falls in past the event horizon.
676.  @1199Zizo It’s all at the center of the black hole, in a region of almost infinite density.
677.  @NorinradPedro They can turn through a full 180 degrees, and if they pass at JUST the right distance can go into permanent orbit around it.
678.  @Donengene Black holes can evaporate unless fed! This is one of Stephen Hawking’s greatest contributions to science.
679.  @keetarpprateek Both are made of matter, but black holes are superdense objects.
680.  @ShreyasD16 Black holes are typically named after the galaxies in which they're located.

896.  @ddubb710 The radiation environment on the surface of Mars is something that we're monitoring with @MarsCuriosity
897.  @murmaidsci88 We do know that it had a field because there are parts of the ancient Mars crust that are still magnetized.
898.  @Dustin_LongNJ We believe that the atmosphere that was lost, has been lost forever to interplanetary space.
899.  @gau3tam7 Earth’s magnetic field largely protects it from these processes.
900.  @BWest187 Storms on the sun happen all the time. These storms increase the UV & radiation environment that affect biological life adversely.
901.  @Hamda930 A compass would not point toward North at Mars. It would point toward the nearest and strongest crustal magnetic field.
902.  @Wjkirik The amount of liquid water on Mars is trace amounts. MAVEN is looking on a larger scale.
903.  @meekelis We see ancient dry river beds, ancient dry lakes - so Mars had to have had a thick atmosphere early on to support liquid water
904.  @srthvnnn Potentially small amount during the geologically brief time of switch. Earth's bigger w/ more gravity so hard for atoms to escape
905.  @MinaVesperGokal Any small scale magnetic field could potentially deflect local solar wind.
906.  @MenTor193 It used to. It was small, froze and stopped making a magnetic field.
907.  @truthordoor Both formed at about the same time, around 4.5 billion years ago.
908.  @SpeakSpanglish The @Space_Station can see the Earth’s aurora, which are caused by solar winds entering the Earth’s atmosphere.
909.  @lngsd The Venus atmosphere is very thick. Similar processes are happening there, but so far it’s still a thick atmosphere.
910.  @Shankovich Yes, MAVEN measured solar wind on the way to Mars. It would depend on the shielding that the spacecraft would have.
911.  @RussellGarcia The rate of change in the loss is also due to solar activity, which we expect was greater during an early sun.
912.  @akgadam Magnetic fields originate at the core of planets. Mars is smaller than Earth, so the core had less heat to keep it molten.
913.  @DanielRika2 Earth is bigger & our core hasn't frozen. We still have a global magnetic field on Earth that helps shield us from solar winds
914.  @BelleBella94 We believe that the Mars atmosphere and climate were significantly different billions of years ago, so yes.
915.  @CodyWillming Billions of years, at the current escape rate.
916.  @extrapale That is part of MAVEN’s investigation. We hope be able to estimate this.
917.  @GunzSonny It’s very unlikely that this would happen. We think much of it was blown away forever.
918.  @DigitalAbdullah MAVEN science results will help us understand and shape what astronauts will be studying at Mars.
919.  @yudisz It widely varies. Summertime at the equator it can get to as high as 10 degrees celsius. But in general it’s much below freezing.
920.  @Tekk45 Not directly, but understanding where the water went on Mars helps figure out where the resources are for future astronauts.
921.  @WindmarkUS We don’t know for sure. But we think that Mars' core was small and froze because there was less heat to keep it molten.
922.  @elakdawalla (2/2) There have been surprises. We've seen unexpected diffuse auroras, transient metal layers in the atmosphere & others.
923.  @elakdawalla In general, the models of the solar wind interaction w/ Mars' atmosphere have been largely validated. (1/2)
924.  @Brummo Global magnetic fields form in the cores of planets. Mars' core is comparatively small and froze, so it's magnetic field ceased.

1435.  @mikelcal So far we’ve detected perchlorates, but there could be other minerals present.
1436.  @SkylarMile All we can see from orbit is what’s on the surface of Mars, and we see evidence of flowing water.
1437.  @brandonbolaa The brine slopes were seen in 2010, but the spectral detection of molecular water was a few months ago.
1438.  @Latienie Not yet, but our InSight mission launches soon & will drill down 5 meters to see how planets evolve: http://t.co/XecnX2x1xO
1439.  @astanzo Yes, we could use this technique on other planetary bodies to find minerals including water.
1440.  @robmantic1 We are detecting salt crystals with molecular water in them, which leads us to believe that the water would not be pure.
1441.  @Scottysthemann There is water on Mars that we could extract, and we hope to identify resources to extract it on future missions.

1444.  @saragreen2013 We've found iron, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen on Mars. Where water interacts with rocks, there is more diversity of mineral.
1445.  @swilson191 Could be, but further investigation is needed to determine where the water is coming from. Updates here: http://t.co/5Qjnv9Tswu
1446.  @themurphmaster There is some oxygen on Mars, but it is a very small concentration compared to the CO2. There wouldn’t be enough to breath.
1447.  @tomerz073 We took images of the dark features and corrected the images pixel by pixel to detect hydration features: http://t.co/rtbAm1Zo4U
1448.  @ThQueen_Rihanna We want to try to narrow down where the water came from, and we'll also look for similar areas on Mars.
1449.  @Kenfohh We don’t know for sure because we don't know how deep the water goes. But we do have some ways to estimate.
1450.  @Luke_huckerby Since the atmosphere is so thin, crops would need some type of enclosure to provide pressure.
1451.  @eleni_nasa Not necessarily on the Mars 2020 rover, but we do plan to continue to study the water on Mars.
1452.  @ShanilSchool At some point in the past, there was a lot of water on Mars. We believe some is still below the surface.
1453.  @SamanthaJoint The great thing is that it’s water near the equator where it’s slightly warmer than the poles.
1454.  @chethanIN It depends on how salty it is. We just don’t know yet. It would likely need to be purified.
1455.  @Lganme We need to find out where the water comes from and get closer imaging of the dark streaks.
1456.  @Burnzy0909 Maybe. It all depends on how saturated with salt the water is. Life as we know it couldn't survive if too salty.
1457.  @havall73 We think a full water cycle existed billions of years ago. We haven’t seen rain, but we have seen snow.
1458.  @renrins @MarsCuriosity @MarsOpportunity We've found similar features within the range of the rover. No plan to do that yet.
1459.  @Meredith7morgan We haven’t seen rain, but we have seen snow. We do think a full water cycle existed billions of years ago.
1460.  @thisisrachels We think the water does evaporate. Because of the salt, it happens must slower. The source of water is the big question.
1461.  @KC_2020 We detected water. It's not circumstantial. We want to go and investigate, but there are no specific mission planned... yet.

1463.  @dragonborn2112 There is water. The features we're seeing on Mars are indeed caused from water flow.
1464.  @denzvryan This is the first detection. Instruments on @MarsCuriosity will help us understand some of the features - an indirect study.
1465.  @RickyAu6 Not yet, but we will explore the possibility of learning more about this discovery.
1466.  @Babababibux In the summer, the temperature can be above freezing. The salt in the water make it more stable.
1467.  @T_C_B_1992 This is the first detection of liquid water. We'll have to wait and see what comes from future discoveries.
1468.  @mashallight We  may be able to break apart the H2O for future astronauts. It's not in the atmosphere.
1469.  @Enyo287 The team was excited, but we needed to make sure the results were robust. We were very happy. The science is the celebration.
